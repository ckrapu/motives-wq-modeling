## National-scale models of nitrogen in streamflow
- Trost (2025) found that particulate species of C/N/P are not well-predicted by land cover catchment characteristics (NLCD) as studied in 27 NEON sites using boosted regression trees. Pasture/Hay class was marked as strongly influential for TDN.
- Manning (2020) uses NAWQA data from all US states to produce a model of total N and total P

## Statistical models of riverine N


## Empirical models of water quality
- Moore (2004) builds a SPARROW model of TN and TP in New England using drainage area, land use, streamflow, time-of-travel, stream density, percent wetlands, slope of the land surface, and soil permeability.
